The opengl version of EMPV is supported only on windows.

Simply run empv.exe to open the application

## TODO
- Editor view
- Only eight total sockets are allowed on the AMDC at a time
- Only four logging sockets can work on the AMDC simultaneously
- Add offset dials for oscilloscope and orbit
- Colour the oscilloscope channels appropriately
- Make frequency view multi-channel
- There are more crashes than I'd like
